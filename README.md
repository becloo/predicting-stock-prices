# predicting stock prices

## Why do we need stock price predictions?

Stock price predictions using machine learning helps one discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. While the entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain profits, predicting how the stock market will perform is a difficult task to accomplish. 

## Problem

Assuming interest in investing $1000 in Facebook, but before doing so I would like to know whether this investment will increase my profit or not. If I find that it will not, I will refrain from investing until another time in the future. If I find that it will increase my profit, I will invest and might consider investing more. Using machine learning, we can try to find the expected performance of Facebook stock and make informed investment decisions.

## Methodology

To accomplish this, I implemented LSTM, an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. The neural network architecture consisted of two LSTM layers, three dropout layers, and a dense layer. Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and keras were used.
